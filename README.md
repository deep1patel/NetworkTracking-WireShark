# NetworkTracking-WireShark-GoogleMaps-Python
Network Traffic visualization using the Python programming language, Wireshark and Google Maps.

This project involved developing a Python-based cybersecurity tool that utilizes Wireshark to track network traffic and then visualizes that data on Google Maps. It could potentially help organizations identify and address vulnerabilities in their networks.
